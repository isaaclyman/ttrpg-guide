READ THIS FIRST:

RPGs will only be included if they are:

- Not defunct: still actively sold and promoted
- Popular: some online community for the game has at least 1,000 members (exceptions on a case-by-case basis, BDFL style)

PLEASE NOTE: ALL RPGs vary depending on the way you run them. For this project, we need hard-and-fast answers. "It depends on the GM" isn't helpful. Do your best to characterize the way the game is designed.
